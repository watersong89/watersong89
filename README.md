- 👋 Hi, I’m @watersong89, a 34-year-old newbie to coding from Edinburgh, Scotland. My background is in music, communication, and education.
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Development and creative ways to implement coded software into every-day life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript. It has taken me a while to get to grips with it, but I finally feel like I'm getting somewhere!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me to upskill, experience new ideas and, ultimately, be creative.
- 📫 How to reach me ... watersongordon@gmail.com
